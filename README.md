Learning is way more efficient if there is a place where you can recover what you have learnt. This is the place for me.

## Goal

To make a structured pathway of beaten struggles as i went by.

## Motivation

Every day happens to me, that I spend hours on google trying to solve issues solved by thousands before myself.

Sometimes it's that bad, that I'm aiming to solve trouble i've already solved in past on my own.

It's very painful and I do not like suffering same as anybody else.

## The story

I study third year bioinformatics a bachelor program at FCT(UCT) combined with FIT(CTU).

During the summer months I've started to work on my bachelor thesis. It's a nice thing but I (finally) realized I need to organize my things up. Naturally I started at least logging all my activities so I could get back to them later. (The form was Google Docs not surprisingly)

It was fine for a while but soon it got pretty messy. By coincidence there was some offer for a lectures a had got interested in, so I started filling the form and there was a very unpleasant box. "Please fill links to your projects, sites or any prove-that-you-know-at-least-something". Obviously, I had nothing in my hands, so I let that box empty.

The hint supposed that any git link is greeted. That was it. We use Git at university for homeworks, but my code is peacefully lying down my untouched pc folders.

It's an awful way to do that. I always think that once I understand something I can remember it forever. The reality is different by much like you can imagine.

So let my brain adapt to something, and that let him to throw it slowly piece by piece away is very nasty approach.

I don't want to do it anymore so that's why I'm going to do my best to refactor the temporary knowledge into sustainable knowledge.

That's the story.
