# learning
 
Learning is way more efficient if there is a place where you can recover what you have learnt. This is the place for me.

## Goal

To remember how to overcome struggles that I once beaten.

## Motivation

Happens every day to me that I spend hours on google trying to solve issues that thousands before me must have overcome.

Sometimes it is even worse when I aim to solve a trouble that I have already solved on my own in past.

Spending such an amount of time
    (1) changing the "google phrase" to find what I want or
    (2) reading pages where the answer simply is not present,
makes me think the more solutions will people share the better for all of us.

## So what this is

Coding journal, list of workarounds, tutorial? A little bit of each one.

### Evolution of this project

I started this project as a random mixture of knowledge that I needed to acquire to complete my assignments.
There were also a lot of things I did not needed for school, but I thought they were either useful or best practices.
Once the files (mostly markdowns) grew in size, it caught my attention, they are really messy and incomprehensible.
So I started to structure things and added some "tutorial stuff" that is easy to find, 
but it puts the information and findings in some perspective.

### Why not documentations and tutorials

So far I think the best place to learn about some technology is the official **documentation**
(python documentation, git documentation - great stuff). 
However, it is usually too burdensome to simply complete a school assignment or personal goal that one wants to achieve.

**Tutorials** are a great source of generally deep knowledge with some inherited structure to teach whole parts.
Ideal if you want to learn the things the tutorial teaches.

Having said that, most of the time I personally just want to get the basics quickly, ideally with the best practices mentioned,
and then cherry pick the knowledge I just need to proceed with my project.
So what is this? This project grow with my knowledges,
    (1) writes down the necessary basic information needed to complete some bachelors and masters courses,
    (2) keeps the struggles solutions,
for anyone who would find this useful including myself.

## How I realized I need to do this

I studied third year of bioinformatics bachelor program.
During the summer months before that I had started to work on my bachelor thesis.
It was kind of nice, but I had realized (after some time) I had needed to organize my things up.
Naturally I had at least started with logging all my activities 
so I could have get back to them later (the log form was Google docs, as you would expect).

It was fine for a while, but it soon got pretty messy. 
By coincidence there was an offer for some selective lectures that interested me,
so I started filling out the form and there was a very nasty text box.
"Please fill links to your projects, sites or any prove-that-you-know-at-least-something".
Obviously, I had nothing in my hands, so I let that box empty.

The text box hint assumed any git link is greeted. That was it. 
We use Git in college for homeworks, but all my code is resting peacefully in my PC folders intact.

Everything was wrong. I don't like to invent the wheel every once in a while,
I don't want others to waste their time the same way I did, over things that are hard to figure them out 
(although someone has already figured them out and just did not report the solutions anywhere), 
and lastly, I want to have some evidence of my learning process.
