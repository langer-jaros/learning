## xpath

### syntax

**nodename** - Selects all nodes with the name "nodename"

**/** - Selects from the root node

**//** - Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are

**.** - Selects the current node

**..** - Selects the parent of the current node

**@** - Selects attributes

**nodename[]** - propagation, selects all nodes, that fits condition inside of []

### examples

/bookstore/book[1]  Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element.
Note: In IE 5,6,7,8,9 first node is[0], but according to W3C, it is [1]. To solve this problem in IE, set the SelectionLanguage to XPath:
```
/bookstore/book[last()-1]
```
Selects the last but one book element that is the child of the bookstore element

```
/bookstore/book[position()<3]
```
Selects the first two book elements that are children of the bookstore element

```
//title[@lang='en']
```
Selects all the title elements that have a "lang" attribute with a value of "en"

```
/bookstore/book[price>35.00]/title
```
Selects all the title elements of the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00
