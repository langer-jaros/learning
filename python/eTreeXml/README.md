### xpath

**tag**

Selects all child elements with the given tag. For example, spam selects all child elements named spam, and spam/egg selects all grandchildren named egg in all children named spam. {namespace}* selects all tags in the given namespace, {*}spam selects tags named spam in any (or no) namespace, and {}* only selects tags that are not in a namespace.

Changed in version 3.8: Support for star-wildcards was added.

**\***

Selects all child elements, including comments and processing instructions. For example, */egg selects all grandchildren named egg.

**.**

Selects the current node. This is mostly useful at the beginning of the path, to indicate that itâ€™s a relative path.

**//**

Selects all subelements, on all levels beneath the current element. For example, .//egg selects all egg elements in the entire tree.

**..**

Selects the parent element. Returns None if the path attempts to reach the ancestors of the start element (the element find was called on).

**[\@attrib]**

Selects all elements that have the given attribute.

**[@attrib='value']**

Selects all elements for which the given attribute has the given value. The value cannot contain quotes.

**[tag]**

Selects all elements that have a child named tag. Only immediate children are supported.

**[.='text']**

Selects all elements whose complete text content, including descendants, equals the given text.

New in version 3.7.

**[tag='text']**

Selects all elements that have a child named tag whose complete text content, including descendants, equals the given text.

**[position]**

Selects all elements that are located at the given position. The position can be either an integer (1 is the first position), the expression last() (for the last position), or a position relative to the last position (e.g. last()-1).
