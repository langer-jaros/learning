## Turorials

### 01 General

- Tensor
- Gradient descent for linear regression
- Logistic regression
- MLP
- Metrics

### 02 Dense Neural Network (DNN)

- checkpoint, early stopping
- save weights, load weights
- regularization (batch normalization)
- show the model
- custom loss function
- custom activation function

### 03 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- conv2D
- Transfer learning
- save weights during learning
- conv1D

### 04 Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

- transfer learning
    - cut last layer, change only the predicted classes, train only the last weights
    - use intermediate layer of trained model as output for your next layer
- tf.keras.layers.LSTM
- Bidirectional(LSTM(50,...))
- GRU
