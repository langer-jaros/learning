## Code (Microsoft Studio Code)

I chosed Microsoft Studio Code. 
You can chose whatever editor you like, just the exact shortcuts will be from MS code.
(Basically anywhere the Down is used there is Up equivalent.)

- undo - Ctrl+Z
- copy line down - Ctrl+Shift+Down
- duplicate cursore down - Ctrl+Alt+Down
- sroll screen up - Ctrl+Up (does not move cursor)
- go to line by number - Ctrl+G - then type line number

## Text (Google Docs)

- cross line - Alt+Shift+5
