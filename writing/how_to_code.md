without falling into deep depresions

## Don't invent the wheel

It is so much more fun, to explore the worl by try and fail approach.
Also it is so less efficient. Don't do it often! Just google it, read it, then try it.
Try in small piecies, not big features.
Any time you want to try something big, elsewhere test every tiny piece.
Testing on simple funcionality, is annoing, useless and quick.
On the other hand writing a piece, debugging it at once is hard, challanging, and slow.
Don't conquer the code, write it.

## Adding funtionality from elsewhere

Always try it before adding to your code!
It will probably work if you don't but it will likely to work in other way than you've expected.

## Test driven development
