## Introduction

This document is written in purpose to simplify the access to the advanced usage of a computer.
The knowledge is based on the PVS course at UCT, Prague.

### Conventions and symbols

| symbols | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[ ]` (square brackets) | means optionality i.e. the things inside may be left out
| `/` (slash) | means exclusive or i.e. it is possible to use either the left or the right part but not both |
| `|` (vertical bar) | means logical (inclusive) or between the the things on the right and on the left |
| `CAPITAL_LETTER` | the words written in uppercase means they should be substituted - in this case with "A" for example.  |

---

## Basics

### First of all

Difference between shell, terminal, bash, command line and prompt

- ctrl+alt+t opens terminal emulator (the window is the terminal emulator).
- The terminal runs the shell programming language (bash, dash, zsh or other shell language).
- The line where you can write commands is called the command line.
- First letters of the command line that are static (does not change by typing) are called the prompt.

- [If not clear see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMSByvFHOro)

#### Open terminal

Press Ctrl+Alt+T.

If it does not work:
1) open menu ~ press super key (windows key)
1) type "term" and you should see either "Terminal", "xterm" or something similar.
1) open it ~ press Enter (double-click).

##### Putty access from Windows

TBD

147.251.253.55

#### The terminal enviroment

Once the terminal is open, what you see is the Command-line interface (CLI).
On the left to the cursor is the prompt, which prompts you to take action.

Usually the prompts tells a name of a current user, the name of the machine (hostname) and the location where the user is relatively to the machine (path). Typicaly it also shows, whether the logged user is a normal user ($) or superuser (#).

Example of common appearance should be:

```
USER_NAME@HOSTNAME:PATH$
```

#### Shell principle 

There are planty of things you can do in terminal. 
However the more programming-like stuff will be usually enclosed to bash script.
That means, the work with terminal (shell) will be mostly about using commands to do the job for you.

#### What happens when I type to terminal

Shell has many words reserved it can be "echo" for printing, "exit" for leaving, or "if" for conditioning.
Besides these, anything you write to the terminal shell expects to be a command.

#### Commands structure

Next to the prompt there is a place for typing commands. 
Shell is case-sensitive, so `exit` works, where `Exit` doesn't.

The shell works like this. 
- The line is executed on press of an enter.
- Most simple is to put one command on one line.
- For one command scenario, the line starts with a command name, folow options and arguments
- Options can be either
    + single letter, starts with hyphen-minus character `-x`
    + full text (no spaces), stars with double minus `--xxxx`
- Argument can be anything

Command structure
```sh
command [-o | --options] [arguments]
```

#### Types of commands

| type | description |
| --- | --- |
| unkonwn | |
| builtins | use `enable` or `compgen -b` |
| executable | files in `/bin` or `/usr/bin` |
| functions | defined functions (by user) |
| aliases | concatenating more commands |

```sh
# To enable or disable shell builtins
enable
# List builtins
compgen -b

# Define function
function greet() { echo "hello"; }

# Create alias
alias my_alias='command_1; command_2'
# Destory alias
unalias
```

#### Info about commands

1) help
1) man
1) info
1) apropos / man -k 

#### USE TAB autocompletion

Whenever, you press tab, the terminal autocomplete the word you are writting.
If there is more than one posibility, nothing happens. Until you press tab twice.
Than it shows you the all the possible completions.
**It's unbeliveable great feature**.

---

#### Expansions and suppressions

Not everything you write shell interprets as you wrote it. Some characters are suppresed, other are expanded.
- white space characters are suppresed
- Example of expansion:
  - Character ~ is expanded as /home/your_username

There are various [expansions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html)
for now is good to know this:
- "double quotes" - suppress all except $ notation
  - does not suppres `$USER` expansion
- 'single quotes' - suppress everything

---

#### Commented text

Everything between a hash sign `#` and the end of the line is ignored.

```sh
# here can be written anything and nothing happens
```

### Files and directories

#### Paths

There is always a need to specify a path to the file a directory you want to work with.
The file can be a document you want to read, an image or simply anything.
Directory is a container for such a files and other directories.
Besides the files and directories the path may specify a command to be used.

There is already a [directory structure](#linux-directory-structure) by default.
Important is that there is one root directory, where every other directories are either in the root directory or nested into its subdirectories. Also every user has its own user directory.
At every point in a terminal you are in some directory.

Directory separator `/`.

```sh
# Show path to the current directory
pwd
# Go (move) to the specified directory
cd /home/username/path/to/the/directory

cd / # go to the root directory
cd . # go to the current directory
cd ~ # go to your home directory
```

If i would have a directory called "tutorial" in my user directory, the path would be

```sh
# The path to the tutorial directory
/home/USER_NAME/tutorial

# or
~/tutorial

# or, if I am in my user directory
./tutorial
```

#### Manipulation with files and directories

```sh
# Create new directory
mkdir NEW_DIRECTORY
mkdir -p ./path/to/end/dir # create every dir that does not exist on the path

# Copy files and directories
cp file1 file2  # Copy file1 to file2
cp -r dir1 dir2 # Copy all from dir1 to dir2

# Move file to another place
mv /old/path/to/file1 /new/path/to/file1
# Rename file1 as file2 and check if not overwriting
mv -i file1 file2
# Create new directory and put everything in
mv ./!(dir1) ./dir1/

# Rename directories tutorial_01,tutorial_02,tutorial_03 to t_01, t_02, t_03
for var in 0{1,2,3}; do mv tutorial_$var t_$var; done
# Replace space with underscore
for file in *; do mv "$file" `echo $file | tr ' ' '_'` ; done
# Add word before extension (file_whatever.png -> file_whatever_historical.png)
for file in *; do mv "$file" $(echo ${file%%.*}_historical.png); done

# Delete files and directories
rm file # Remove file
rm -r   # Remove directory (recursively with all files)
```

- [replace spaces link](https://vitux.com/how-to-replace-spaces-in-filenames-with-underscores-on-the-linux-shell/)

#### Information about files, directories

##### Commands: ls, tree, du, wc, stat

```sh
# Shows all files of given directory
ls ./path/to/the/directory

# Show structure of all files and dictionaries from your dictionary 
tree

# Shows counts of lines, words and bytes
wc FILE_NAME
# show number of lines (-l) words (-w) and bytes (-c)
wc -l FILE_NAME

# Recursively shows sizes (disk usage) of directories and files 
du ./path/to/the/directory 
# Show size of the DIRECTORY and its direct children (2 ~ levels down etc.) 
du -d 1 ./path/to/the/DIRECTORY
du -hs FILE_NAME # Display info in human readable form (-h) only for the top folder (-s)

# show file statistics
stat file1
```

#### Compression and decompression

(Uploading and downloading in ohter way is **damn** slow)

#### Command zip

Zip files into new.zip

```sh
zip new file1 file2 file3
```

Unzip files from new.zip
```sh
unzip new.zip
# to NEW_DIR
unzip new.zip -d PATH/NEW_DIR
```

#### Command tar

+ Compress files to new.tar.gz
```sh
# -c = create
# -v = verbose
# -z = gzip / gz / zip
# -f = following files

tar -cvzf new.tar.gz file1 file2 file3
```
+ Decompress from new.tar.gz
```
# -x = extract

tar -xvzf oldFile.tar.gz
```
+ Decompress from new.tar.bz2
```
# -j = bz2
# -C = where to extract

tar -xvjf oldFile.tar.bz2 -C /path/Directory
```

[source - bz2](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-extract-unzip-tar-bz2-file/)

---

#### Links

**soft link**
- Points to the original file, can be used as the original file for multiple purposes.

```sh
# Ways to create soft links
ln -s FILENAME LINKNAME
cp -s FILENAME LINKNAME
```

Example Usage
- I installed "code_like_hell" editor with the executable file at /usr/share/code_like_hell/bin/code_like_hell
- I want to open the editor just by typing `ch` to the terminal.
- So I create an symbolic link called `ch` at the `/usr/bin` directory.

```sh
ln -s /usr/share/code_like_hell/bin/code_like_hell /usr/bin/ch
```

**hard link**
- Acts like a synchronized copy of the original file, change in one file changes the other.

```sh
# Hard link creations
ln FILENAME LINKNAME
cp -l FILENAME LINKNAME
```

---

### Wildcards - symbols with special meaning

Especially useful when we don't know the name exactly or we perhaps want to use more than one exact name.

```sh
* # Anything

? # One character

# Not containing anything from bracket
[! ] # [^ ] # Equivalent in RegEx

# Ranges
[a-dsu]
[3-7a-g]

# Groups
[:digit:]
[:alpha:]
[:alnum:]
[:upper:]
[:lower:]

# Examples
ls ?[[:digit:]]*
ls ?[4-6]
```

### Install stuff

#### Install from official repositories

```sh
sudo apt-get install ALMOST_ANYTHING
```

#### Install from package .deb

Works the same way for an update.

```sh
sudo dpkg -i PACKAGE_NAME.deb
# attempt to fix corrupted dependencies

### User management and privileges

#### TBD Basic commands

```sh
groupmod
whoami
who
groups
```

#### Add,delete  user | group

```sh
adduser USERNAME
deluser USERNAME
groupadd GROUPNAME
goupdel GROUPNAME
```

#### Add user to group

```sh
usermod -a -G GROUP USER
```

#### Group information

Read file containing information about groups.
Every line of the file has following structure:
GROUP_NAME:PASSWORD:GROUP_ID:GROUP_USER_1, GROUP_USER_2, GROUP_USER_3

```sh
less /etc/group
```

#### Change password

```sh
[sudo] passwd [username]
```

#### Switch user

```sh
su USERNAME
```

Every su opens a new shell.

```sh
# Show number of open shells
echo $SHLVL
```

#### Superuser

Login as superuser, superuser password required.
```sh
su
```
Login as superuser, current user's password required.
```sh
sudo su
```
Grant to the command privileges of superuser.
```sh
sudo COMMAND
```

#### User permissions

Everything has permissions set.

Example

```sh
ls -la
#drwxrwxrwx NUMBER USER USER NUMBER DATE NAME_OF_THE_FILE
```
The first 10 letters are the permissions, the structure follows
```
-        ---  ---   ---
filemode user group others
```

File types

+ d - directory 
+ l - link 	
+ b - bloc type (harddisc) 
+ c - chartype

#### Change permissions

```
chmod u-x
	rename needs directory privileges
	to read files directory needs r+x
	to rename files directory needs w+x
	--- 000	0
	--x 001 1
	-w- 010 2
	-wx 011 3
	r-- 100 4... 	chmod 755 text.txt chmod u=rw,g+rw ccc.txt
```

```sh
/etc/shadow

setuid bit 		chmod 	u+s ... 4777
setgid bit 		chmod	g+s ...	2777
sticky bit 		chmod	+t ...	1777

umask	0224		d- 777	f- 666
```

#### Change ownership

```sh
chown USER[:GROUP] OBJECT
```

---

### Files - advanced

```sh
# Create new (empty) file
touch path/to/my/newFileName.anything

# Print sth to terminal
echo sth

# Take output of command and writes it to the file
COMMAND > FILE
echo text > file_example

# Take output of command and writes it at the end of file
COMMAND >> APPENDED_FILE
echo next >> APPENDED_FILE

# Output every line from file
cat file

# Output every line from file in reverse order
tac file

# Output first 5 lines from file in reverse order
head file
# Output first n lines from file in reverse order
head -n 3 file

# Output last 5 lines from file in reverse order
tail file

# Sort output

# Example 
sudo du -a | sort -n -r | head -n 20
```

#### Compare two files

#### Command diff

```sh
diff --side-by-side --suppress-common-lines FILE_A FILE_B

diff --side-by-side --suppress-common-lines FILE_A FILE_B | more
```
or
```sh
diff -u file1 file2
```

file_2 as stdin

```sh
some_command | diff file_1 -
```

### Environments and variables

Variables and functions, can be exported (global) or not.

#### set

can be used to set various shell options, or the positional parameters. If no arguments or options are given, then it prints all shell variables and functions.

#### Print value of variable

```sh
echo ${...}
```

#### compgen -v

outputs only names of all shell variables, exported or not.

### Text transformation

#### tr

```sh
# Example: Remove spaces from filename
ls # name\ with\ spaces.txt
for file in *; do mv "$file" `echo $file | tr ' ' '_'` ; done
ls # name_with_spaces.txt
```

Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.

```
tr [OPTIONS] SET1 [SET2]
```

Translate charactes

Command expects arguments `SET1 SET2` where SET1 are characters to be translated with SET2.

echo "characters" | tr abc 123
# Characters specified by range
echo "characters" | tr a-z 1-3
echo "chArACtERs" | tr a-z A-Z
# Characters specified by POSIX
echo "chArACtERs" | tr [:lower:] [:upper:]
# First range is shorter - nothing special
echo "aaabbbccc" | tr a-b 1-3
# First range is longer - characters from SET1 without partner are replaced with last form SET2
echo "aaabbbccc" | tr a-c 1-2
```

Remove characters

```sh
# remove characters
echo "aaabbbccc" | tr -d ab
# replace repetitions with one occurance
echo "aaabbbccc" | tr -s ab 
echo "abcabcabc" | tr -s ab
```

### Expansions

## Shell scripts

```sh
shell
    max 255 znaků
    echo $0
    PATHS: /etc/shells
    chsh username
script
    exec. - $PATH / path/script 
    #!/bin/bash

        -t secs
        -s
        IFS = ':'
        X NEVER - echo "abc" | read
```

### Comments

Comments are also more useful for writting bash scripts but it is important to know what the hesh means.

```bash
<<< #here-string
```

```bash
#<< OPENCLOSE  #here-document 
OPENCLOSE

# same as

#<< _COMMENT_
lalala
_COMMENT_

# Commad True
True '    '
# Same as
:' '
```

### Variables

Define variables

```bash
# var=value - spaces must be escaped
number=1       # number
string=hello # strings

# Arrays
array=(1 2 nn pp gg)    # space separated array
arr[3]=there            # define with index
```

Access variables

```bash
echo ${var}

# Access array
echo ${arr} # first item
echo ${arr[0]} # first item
echo ${arr[1]} # second item

echo ${arr[@]} # full array
echo ${arr[*]} # array as a string
```

```bash
var=
# :-value -> pokud v proměnné není nic, vypíše se value, ale nepřiřadí se
echo ${var:-nothing}
echo $var
# :=value -> přiřadí i proměnnou(taková default)
echo ${var:="value "}
# :? -> na prázdnost,vrátí -1, nebo zvolenou hlášku
echo ${var:?"value "}
# :+123 -> pokud není prázdná, dočasněji změn na 123
echo ${var:+"value "}
```

```bash
# vrátí podle vzoru všechny proměnné, které mu odpovídají
echo ${!pattern} 
echo ${!S*}
```

```bash
# Make first letter uppercase # lowercase
echo ${var^} # ${var,}
# Make all letters uppercase # lowercase
echo ${var^^} # ${var,,}
#  nahraď pattern valuelem :P -> pouze pro 1. výskyt vzoru
echo ${var/pattern/value}
# Change all pattern matches with value
echo ${var//pattern/value}
# #pattern -> trim pattern form left
${var#pattern}
# ##pattern -> trim longest pattern form left
${var##pattern}
# %pattern    -> trim pattern from right
${var%pattern}
# %%pattern   -> trim the longest pattern form right
${var%%pattern}
```

[lowercase uppercase strings](https://linuxhint.com/bash_lowercase_uppercase_strings/)

```bash
# :offset -> usekne 4 znaky od začátku a pouze do 6
echo ${aaa:4:6}
# : -offset -> od konce
echo ${aaa -6:3}
```

#### Numbers (arithmetic expansion)

```bash
# Operators + - * / % ** ++ --
echo $((10)) # 10
# Octal base
echo $((010)) # 8
# Hexadecimal base
echo $((0x10)) # 16
# Base#Number
echo $((7#13)) # 10
```

- [math in bash scripts](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/unix_sg/bash/math.html)


#### Variable Scope

```sh
[implicit (global) | local optional] variablename
```

### Printf

```bash
printf "{%s: %s}\n" "$m_key" "$m_name"
```

### Exit status

Every command in bash returns a status, number between 0 and 255, 0 menas success.

```sh
# Read the last exit status
echo $?
# See exit status of my_script
my_script -opt file_name; echo $?
```

Bash script or terminal itself can return status code, command exit

```sh
# Success
exit # exit 0
# Failure
exit 1 # exit 255

# Commands true and false
true # ignore any input and exit 0
false # ignore any input and exit 1
```

### Bracket tests

#### Square bracket test

Example usage: `[ unary_op argument ]`

**The space after the first and before the second bracket are required** 

Unary test operators

| unary_op | description             |
| ---      | ---                     |
| -f       | is file                 |
| -d       | is directory            |
| -L       | is symbolic link        |
| -r       | is readable by test     |
| -w       | has permision to write  |
| -x       | is executable           |
| -s       | is not empty            |

Example

```bash
[ -s experiment]; echo $?
```

Three arguments usage: `[ arg1 binary_op arg2 ]`

Example
```bash
# is file1 olther than file2
[ file1 -ot file2 ]; echo $?
```

Test strings

| binary_op | description |
| ---       | ---         |
| -n        |             |
| -z        |             |
| =         |             |
| !=        |             |
| <         |             |
| >         |             |

Test numbers

| binary_op | description |
| ---       | ---         |
| -eq       |             |
| -ne       |             |
| -lt       |             |
| -le       |             |
| -gt       |             |
| -ge       |             |

Example:

```bash
[ f1 -nt f2 ]; echo $?
```

#### Double square bracket test (Bash only)

Usage `[[_arg1 op arg2_]]`

1) Numbers can be compared straight `x1` (not $x1)
2) `x1 == x2(d)`
3) `x1 =~ ERE`


#### Double bracket test

Usage `((_arg1 op arg2_))`

1) `$x1 .... x1` i pro stringy
2) `==` funguje pro cisla

Assign value

| binary_op | description |
| ---       | ---         |
| +=        |             |
| -=        |             |
| /=        |             |
| %=        |             |
| *=:       |             |
| ++        |             |
| --        |             |

Ternary operator (conditional)

- `(( arg1? arg2 : arg3 ))`

```
(( a<1? (a=+2) : (a-=3) ))
```

Logic operators

```
AND     -a 		&&
OR      -o 		!!
NOT     !		!
```

### Conditions

```sh
if commands; then commands; fi

if [[ condition ]]; then
	commands
elif [[ condition ]]; then
	commands
else
	commands
fi
```

Usually the `if` statement is not needed.

```
# Usage
command1 OPERATOR command2
```

| OPERATOR  | Action |
| ---       | ---    |
| `;`       | Executes both commands (it is the same as type the enter)             |
| `&&`      | Executes the command2 if the command1 exit code was 0 (AND)           |
| `||`      | Executes the command2 only if the command1 exit code was not 0 (OR)   |
| `&`       | Executes the command2 right after the command1 no matter what         |

```bash
case variable in
pattern)
    commands;
;;
pattern2) commands;
;;
esac
```

PATERN:

```
letter)
*)
?)  e.g.    ???.txt)
[abc])  OR  [3-9])  OR  [[:digit:]])
```

```bash
select variable in[list] do
    commands;

```

### Loops

```bash
for  var [in ${LIST}]; do
    commands;
done

# words

done

break number    # breaks to the defined level 
continue number # implicit 1; starts next iteration of def. loop
```

### Arguments

```sh
# Echo arguments (get argument by number)
echo $0 # Argument 0 - how the script was called
echo $1 # First argument
echo $2 # second argument

echo $# # Number of arguments

echo $* # All arguments as one string
echo $@ # Array of all arguments

# shift the arguents number
shift   # shift it by one
shift 4 # shift it by 4
```

### Functions

What function can and can not do
- `return` code in range 0-255
- `exit` script with code 0-255
- function has its own positional parameters e.g. $1 $@ (does not change the script one)
- it can change variables that are outside of that function
- anything else as code outside of a function

```sh
function name {
    commands;
}

name () {
    commands;
}

return # if not, then exit status of function is the es of last function
```

Return string from function
```sh
# The key is to echo at the last line of the function
get_str() {
    # Multiple lines of anything
    echo str
}

x=$(get_str)
```
