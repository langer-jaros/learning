## TeX vs LaTeX 

TeX is both a program (which does the typesetting, tex-core) and format (a set of macros that the engine uses, plain-tex). 
LaTeX is a generalised set of macros to let you do many things. Most people don't want to have to program TeX, especially to set up things like sections, title pages, bibliographies and so on. LaTeX provides all of that: these are the 'macros' that it is made up of.
